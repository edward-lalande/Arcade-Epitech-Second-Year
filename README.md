Arcade is a project where we have to recreate an arcade machine where we can play various games under various graphics libraries.

Games are shared libraries just like graphics libraries

To date, SDL2 is not functional but is currently being processed.

To test it, clone the repositories then do 

```
make && ./arcade lib/arcade_sfml.so
```

the graphics libraries are on the left to select them you have to click on them and in ncurse you have to click on the corresponding key.

Enjoy!
